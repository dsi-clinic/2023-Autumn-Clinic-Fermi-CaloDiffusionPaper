# Sbatch Directory

This directory was made this quarter to store some of our sbatch scripts. While none of this code is meant to work "out of the box," it provides a concrete set of examples meant to help new students on this project get a grasp of how they might run our scripts using the DSI cluster. The template file ```run.sh.tpl``` is a good place to start for new students. To run one of these files, simply ssh into a fe01.ds.uchicago.edu, then run ```sbatch {name of script}```.
