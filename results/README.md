# Results

In this folder, we will collect scripts and notebooks that allow us to share and reproduce the results we've made over the course of the quarter.

To keep track of each result, we need the following: 
 1. A short name to describe the result, like "optimal batch size for AE on dataset 3". 
 2. A script or notebook (possibly multiple) one can run to reproduce the results.
 3. Any hard-coded paths in the script or notebook. For example, if the result needs a pre-trained autoencoder's weights, that should be noted in this column.

| Result Name | Script or Notebook | Hard-coded paths |
